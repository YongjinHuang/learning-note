The interpreter in V8 is called Ignition, and is responsible for generating and executing bytecode. While it runs the bytecode, it collects profiling data, which can be used to speed up the execution later. When a function becomes hot, for example when it's run often, the generated bytecode and the profiling data are passed on to TurboFan, our optimizing compiler, to generate highly-optimized machine code based on the profiling data
