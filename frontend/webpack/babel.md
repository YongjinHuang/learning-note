# Babel

## What is Babel?

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers on environments. Here're the main things Babel can do for you:
+ Transform syntax
+ Polyfill features that are missing in your target environments
+ Source code transformation (codemods)

> **Keep in mind that Babel doesn't do type checking**

## Plugins

Babel's code transformations are enabled by applying plugins (or presets) to your configuration file. 

## Presets
Babel presets can act as sharable set of Babel plugins and/or config options
