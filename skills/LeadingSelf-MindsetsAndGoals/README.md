# Own Your Career Framework
We are the owners of our careers. The route to success begins with us being intentional with our actions to prepare for the future

The following Own Your Career Framework serves to guide us in being more intentional in considering the elements that are crucial when it comes to our careers

+ **Me <> Strength** : Uncover your strengths by getting feedback from others, reflecting on yourself, or utilising assessment tools
+ **Me For Others <> Value Proposition** : Think about how your strengths can fit into what is required of you in your team or organisation
+ **Me With Others <> Support Network** : Identify the people that you can tap on to help you achieve your professional goals
+ **Me For & With Others <> Opportunity** : Think about the overlap between what your team or the organisation needs and what you're good at

To manage our stakeholders effectively, we can utilise the [influence-interest matrix](https://www.projectmanagement.com/contentPages/wiki.cfm?ID=368897&thisPageURL=/wikis/368897/Stakeholder-Analysis--using-the-Power-Interest-Grid#_=_)
1. **Influence** = The degree to which your stakeholders can affect the work that you do
2. **Interest** = The degree to which your stakeholders care about the work that you do

> ***Key players*** are individuals that can be considered gatekeepers to your future opportunities. They usually have industrial knowledge or skills that you can learn from, and they may also have a robust network of resources that you can potentially tap on.
> ***Peers*** are your colleagues or friends you work closely with on a regular basis. You can tap on them for additional input, perspectives, or resources.
> ***Acquaintances*** represent the group of people that you have occasional interactions with. They are still connections that we want to acknowledge. 


How do we manage and maintain our relationships?
1. **Key Players with high influence and high interest** : *Manage Closely*. We should keep them engaged and manage their expectations closely as they have the biggest impact on our work
2. **Key Players with high fluence and low interest** : *Keep Satisfied*. We should keep them satisfied as they play important and influential roles in our projects
3. **Peers with low influence and high interest** : *Keep Informed*. We should keep them adequately informed so that we can reach out to them for support
4. **Acquaintances with low interest and low influence** : *Monitor*. We can maintain healthy relationships and manage an appropriate level of communication with them


# Setting Goals Effectively
A **goal** is a destination that guides and fuels our every move. It provides us with clarity on the meaning of our work and how it contributes to our growth

How can I identify my goals?
1. Consider your vision
2. Consider your areas of personal growth
3. Consider your opportunites

[The Five Principles of Effective Goal Setting](https://youtu.be/dWOt2HyjCno) are:
1. **Clarity** : Set clear and specific goals
    + Be clear and specific about the results you want
    + Have [specific](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/career-business/the-6-steps-to-a-smart-goal/) measurements of success for your goals
2. **Challenge** : Set goals that are challenging and attainable
    + Set goals that [are challenging enough to motivates you](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/inverted-u.htm)
    + Seek [stretch goals](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/stretch-goals) that exceed your actual target, which require you to think differently and find new ways to solve challenges
3. **Commitment** : Set goals you know you will commit to
    + Visualize a mental image of what you and your life will be like when you've achieved your goal
    + Set milestones for each goal, and use tools to track and measure your progress
4. **Feedback** : Set time for monitoring progress
    + Schedule time to analyse your progress and accomplishments
    + Ask others for feedback on your progress
5. **Task Complexity** : Assess complexity of goals
    + Give yourself time to achieve your goals
    + If you're stressed and struggling, reassess your goals and modify them if necessary
    + Break large goals into subgoals

We may encounter situations where we don't know how to set measurable goals, especially if our goals are more qualitative. However, do note that **every goals needs to be results-oriented and measurable to identify success**. To add some **element of measurement** to our qualitative goals, we can include:
1. Dates or duration(E.g., In the next 4 months)
2. Percentage increase or decrease(E.g., Increase by 10%)
3. Numerical value(E.g., 10,000 views per advertisement)

# [Growth Mindset](https://youtu.be/KUWn_TJTrnU)

A **growth mindset** describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. Those with a growth mindset believe that abilities are not fixed and that skills can improve over time with **hard work and effort**

> Why Should You Have a Growth Mindset?
> Embracing and adopting a growth mindset allows us to **view failures as a stepping stone to success**, instead of a detriment

One of the key differences between a fixed and growth mindset is **how we face setbacks and challenges**

With a fixed mindset, we're more likely to:
+ Avoid challenges
+ Believe that we're either good or bad at something even before attempting these challenges
+ Have a fear of failing or not being approved of by others

With a growth mindset, we're more likely to:
+ Embrace challenges
+ See challenges as an opportunity to learn and be better versions of ourselves

So how does one [develop a growth mindset](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2021/01/06/the-value-of-a-growth-mindset-and-how-to-develop-one/?sh=303948294d2f)?
1. Remind yourself that you're capable of all the change you need
2. Avoid blaming the circumstances or others for your shortcomings
3. Be curious about things you are not familiar with and ask questions to learn more 
4. Allow yourself to fail and see them as stepping stones on the path to success 
5. Challenge yourself to operate outside your comfort zone
6. Reward yourself for your efforts and avoid placing undue emphasis on results
7. Use admiration instead of envy as a tool to guide you along the road to success
8. Challenge yourself without fearing failure and judgement of others

Although we may have a certain level of fixed mindset in us, adopting a growth mindset can help us tackle challenges more effectively. Instead of viewing failures and challenges negatively, we should take them as opportunities to learn and grow to become better versions of ourselves.
